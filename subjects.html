			<h1 class="heading">Descrete Mathematics:-</h1>
			<p>Discrete Mathematics Classes has been taken by prof. Manoj Jha sir And Prof Madhavi Sakya man. Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are countable or otherwise distinct and separable. Examples of structures that
			are discrete are combinations, graphs, and logical statements. ... In contrast, discrete mathematics concerns itself mainly with finite collections of
			discrete objects.Overall, most students find discrete math to be a hard class when compared to math classes at a similar level such as calculus or linear
			algebra. This is because discrete math tends to be the first exposure most students have to proofs.</p>
			<h2>Expectation:-</h2>
			<p>This subject is not about the material thought in the class, is about sharing knowledge, experiences and interaction among all class. The most important
			lesson that we might have in our schools but I would argue not to the extent I am describing.I expect to this subject thai i gain more knowladge about logical math.</p>
			</div>

			<h1 class="heading">Computer Organization and Architecture:-</h1>
			<p>Computer Organization and Architecture classes has been taken by Prof. Anoop tiwari sir. Computer Organization and Architecture is the study of internal working, structuring and implementation of a computer system.Organization of 
			computer system is the way of practical implementation which results in realization of architectural specifications of a computer system.The subject
			explores how machines are designed, built, and operate. Knowing what's inside and how it works will help you design, develop, and implement applications
			better, faster, cheaper, more efficient, and easier to use because you will be able to make informed decisions instead of guestimating and assuming.</p>
